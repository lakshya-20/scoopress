## Improving Awareness and Behaviour
### Short Description

There is a website in which there will be authorized users who will be able to post news (Preventing Fake News) and there is an Honor page in which we can apprise health workers.

### Long Description

Since the information regarding the pandemic is changing rapidly, a lot of fake news and fake claims are rising too. The spread of this kind of mess is creating an adverse impact on the common people, who are residing in their home for about a month without stepping out of their doorsteps and try to appreciate health workers such that they will not loose their hope, in order to reduce the spread of the Corona Virus. Psychology of these people become completely dependent on the media, not only in this pandemic but also in the normal days, which creates a drastic impact in one's life, either it can be positive or negative depending upon the situation and the correctness of the media. 
So, it is important to provide genuine news and made them know what they need to know, and also what they need to do (especially in this pandemic). 
Therefore, we are focusing on creating an online platform that would provide genuine news from authorized media, it would provide a platform from where humans can apprise health workers and their teams and most importantly, it would tackle the fake rumors, claims or news to show the truth behind them. Also, it would show visualized stats of COVID-19 spread in real-time around the world. This online platform is none other than a website, which will contain all of the above. We believe that this interactive website would help to improve the awareness and the behavior of the people.
